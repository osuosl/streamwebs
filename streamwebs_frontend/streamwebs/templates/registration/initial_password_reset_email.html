Hello StreamWebs user {{ user.get_full_name }},

We are excited to announce the launch of our new website!

We have some exciting new features:

- ability to extract the data that you have entered into a spreadsheet (such as Excel) for further manipulation in the classroom
- side-by-side comparison of water quality for two sites
- less complicated water quality graphs, with the added ability to view individual data points in a histogram.

A couple of our less frequently used datasheets were not incorporated into our new site: Invasive species, StreamFlow, and Pebble Count. These datasheets are still available for you to use and can be downloaded as PDFâ€™s from the site, but are no longer supported for entering data into the website.

You will also notice that individual users no longer have a profile page; however, you will still be able to find your data attached to the site pages. You will be able to see your contributions to the site and find data by looking at your school or organization.

As with any new website, there may still be issues for us to work out. Please let us know by email if you experience any errors, and we will work to resolve them. We welcome your feedback during this transition!

If you have any questions or issues, you can contact us at info@streamwebs.org. Thank you!
