<h5 class="teal-text">How do I access my old account?</h5>
<p>
    You will receive an email to the address you used to sign up on the
    original site. From there, you can reset your password and use the same
    login on the new site! If you didn't receive an email, you can also reset
    your password by clicking on "Login" and then "Forgot your password?" and
    then input the original email you used.
</p>
<br/>

</br/>
<h5 class="teal-text">What's different about the site?</h5>
<p>
The site has been given a modernized look and feel. Youâ€™ll also have access to
the following new features:
</p>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>
      You now have the ability to extract the data that you have entered into
      the site, in the form of a spreadsheet (.csv) for further manipulation in
      outside spreadsheet programs such as Excel.
    </li>
    <br/>

    <li>
      You can now compare water quality data for two sites side-by-side. No
      more switching tabs to compare water qualities between two locations!
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      The water quality graphs have been simplified for a cleaner and less
      cluttered viewing experience. Individual data points are averages of all
      the data entries submitted that day. You can now click on these to view
      as histograms.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      Some of our less-used datasheets are no longer supported for entry into
      the new site. These include the Invasive Species, StreamFlow, and Pebble
      Count datasheets. These are still available on the resource section of
      the site in PDF format.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      You will also notice that individual users no longer have a unique
      profile page, but you can still find all of your data located on the
      sites in which you have participated.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h5 class="teal-text">What if I run into an unexpected error?</h5>
      As with any new website, there are bound to be some issues (we like to
      call these "unexpected features"). If you do encounter any issues, please
      send us an email at <a
      href="mailto:info@streamwebs.org">info@streamwebs.org</a> and we will
      work with you to resolve them as quickly as we can.
