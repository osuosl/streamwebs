          The StreamWebs Student Stewardship Network is an educational
          platform that provides teachers and students with resources to
          conduct based hands-on watershed stewardship projects. The
          StreamWebs program works to promote the teaching and learning of
          field based science, enhance environmental literacy, and provide
          resources that support 
          <a href="http://www.noaa.gov/explainers/noaa-meaningful-watershed-educational-experience">
              Meaningful Watershed Education Experiences
          </a>
          (MWEEs).
          <br><br>
          By providing students and teachers open-source, web-based tools
          for watershed data collection, analysis, and a multimedia showcase
          for their project and data reports, StreamWebs helps to bridge
          student field experiences back to the classroom and vice versa.
          StreamWebs hopes to increase understanding and stewardship of
          watersheds and related ocean, coastal, riverine, and estuarine
          ecosystems and to help students and teachers demonstrate their role
          as vital contributors to watershed sustainability.
          <br><br>
          StreamWebs is a program of Oregon Sea Grant and Oregon State
          University Extension Service and is supported by the National
          Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Bay and Watershed
          Education Training (BWET) program.
