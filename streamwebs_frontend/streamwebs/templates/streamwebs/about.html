    <p>
      The StreamWebs Student Stewardship Network is an educational
      platform that provides teachers and students with resources to
      conduct hands-on watershed stewardship projects. The
      StreamWebs program works to promote the teaching and learning of
      field based science, enhance environmental literacy, and provide
      resources that support
      <a href="http://www.noaa.gov/explainers/noaa-meaningful-watershed-educational-experience">
        Meaningful Watershed Education Experiences
      </a>
      (MWEEs).
      <br/><br/>
      By providing students and teachers open-source, web-based tools
      for watershed data collection, analysis, and a multimedia showcase
      for their project and data reports, StreamWebs helps to bridge
      student field experiences back to the classroom and vice versa.
      StreamWebs hopes to increase understanding and stewardship of
      watersheds and related ocean, coastal, riverine, and estuarine
      ecosystems and to help students and teachers demonstrate their role
      as vital contributors to watershed sustainability.

      StreamWebs is a program of Oregon Sea Grant and Oregon State
      University Extension Service and is supported by the National
