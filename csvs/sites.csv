We left the school and got on the max green line. There weren't as many people on it as I would expect.We then got off at the Flavel stop and walked up the giant hill to get up to the Tenino Court. Once we were finally there we broke up into our groups that we were assigned to and had been in the whole time.
     From what I can remember, it was a pretty nice day outside.It was kinda of chilly but it was sunny. Once I began moving around and getting my blood pumping it was not really that cold anymore. It smelled of decaying leaves, like it always does at the end of the fall season. Depending on where I was at the moment, the ground was dry in some places but almost a complete swamp in others.
     The water chemistry/ water quality group, which is the one that I was assigned to, got good data on the last day. We tested the waters pH level, turbidity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen level. To get a decent sample, sometimes you had to go out in the more swampier parts of Tenino Court, which wasn't a problem for me since I was wearing rain boots, but for some of the other people in my group their shoes were screwed after being out in the muddy parts we sometimes had to go to.
     Overall, it was a good experience. I had a good time at Tenino Court throughout the whole semester but the last day or the trip before that were one of the best/ funnest days we went out there. I look forward to doing it all again next semester.

This wetland is east of the Ashland Middle School.  Much of the wetland is on school district property.  The north portion is on property belonging to Gracepoint Church.  The area is affected by what is called the Normal Neighborhood Plan. It is a ~90 acre undeveloped area within the urban growth boundary of Ashland.  Due to likely changes in the future of this site, and to accessibility by students, an the ecological importance of wetlands, it was adopted for monitoring.  According to the plan, most of the wetland will be preserved as open space. Student started monitoring in spring of 2014, establishing photo points and vegetation transects.  Permission was granted by the church for students to access their portion of the property -Rachel Werling"

For our project, we will have multiple field days in Wildwood Recreational Park in Welches, Oregon for data collection and survey. We will be testing the water flow rate, temperature and dissolved oxygen rates while also surveying what invertebrates call the Salmon River home and how they affect the ecosystem.

Tabor park. We are using areas of Himalyan Black Berry, English Ivy and Scotch Broom as test invasive species area. There are unknown streams full of macroinvertbrates in there in the park. We are keeping these area's exact location a secret to protect the identities of the most sensitive species. The park has good Douglas Fir canopy cover in parts. This is great for canopy cover testing. The secret streams do not have much flow so we made up those data sheets. The water quality data for the Mt. Tabor site is a bit of a stretch as well. I am hoping that this description is now long enough to test the new display. This will be using the same basic setup as the user profile bio display where it shows you the first 400 characters with a ""more"" link that can be used to display the full description of the project site."

The goal of the project is to learn about stream health, form hypotheses to explain stream health, research and propose riparian remediation, implement propositions, and test effectiveness of propositions via student prescribed methods of assessing stream health. This project would be implemented as an integral piece of the school-wide curriculum, supported by place based lessons from curricula found in Project Learning Tree, Project Wild, Project Wet, and Project Aquatic.
Wolf Creek is a year around stream that flows through the town of Wolf Creek, Oregon. Wolf Creek is feed by various unnamed seasonal streams and springs. Wolf Creek drains into Grave Creek which eventually drains into the Rogue River.  The section of Wolf Creek that adjoins the school property is approximately 100 yards long. We would focus our projects within this area. This section of Wolf Creek is open to public use. Even-though a field, about an acre in size and Wolf Creek is on school property, it is not fenced and is generally seen as a place anyone can use. Currently this area is not highly respected by the public that do use it. There are various illegal fire pits, litter, and it is sometimes used as a dumping ground.
Last school year staff and students participated in a SOLVe-It clean-up project. The field was mowed by a community volunteer, and a part of the riparian zone was pre-cleared/cut of invasives by staff and community volunteers. Students and staff then gathered trash and plant debris in the riparian zone. After the area was cleared, staff and students planted native Redwood, Port Orford Cedar, and Douglas Fir trees. Unfortunately, we experienced a summer with devastating wildfires and extremely hot and dry conditions. Most of our trees died and many invasives are back. In addition, this area and Wolf Creek continue to be used as place to dump old tires and various other types of litter. A fundamental piece of this project is to develop a sense of ownership and stewardship of this and other natural areas. We believe that this will be a happy consequence of this project.
By beginning participation in the project starting in Kindergarten and participating, with increasing intensity, in multiple, scientific method, “cycles” of the project, students will build a sense of ownership in their education/community, become experts with the scientific process, and make connections with various community, government, and non-profits. In this project students will make observations and record data concerning the natural world and more specifically Wolf Creek. They will compare their data with accepted scientific norms of stream health and form hypotheses to explain observed conditions. These first two steps will be implemented in the first year of the project. In the years following, students will continue with data gathering and observations and will research previously implemented riparian mitigation and stream restoration methods that have been shown to mitigate the observed issues with Wolf Creek. Students will then propose a service project that they hypothesize will improve the conditions found in Wolf Creek. Students will then seek out funding and implementation methods for their proposed mitigation. Throughout this process students will be continuing with scheduled data gathering and observations. Students will carry out the proposed mitigation. Students will then gather data and compare with previous data. They will then decide if their mitigation was effective and begin the process anew.
Students will be expected to continuously report data and progress via technology, charts, graphs, and displays. They will also be expected to inform the community of their project by making presentations at school open house events. In addition, students will be expected to collaborate with community, government, and non-profit organizations. As a piece of this collaboration, they will share data, observations, and plans using technology via in-person meetings and electronic communications.   "
