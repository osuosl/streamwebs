The first site was the end of the channel in faster water. 
In the second site, we saw one mayfly, one mosquito larva, and one leech. It was a slow moving pool that was off the main channel and it was very sedimentary, and there was nothing for organisms to take cover. 
The third site was the mouth of the side channel. It was fast moving and had medium to small rocks. We took the sample from underneath a placed log. There was nothing there to write any data for organisms.
The water was very high. It was too high for us to be able to go into the middle of the channel and sample it."

Site #2 dried up due the the change in water flow thought the side channel so site #4 was put in to replace it.
In Site #3 at the end of the side channel we found 9 caddisflies, 3 riffle beetles, 1 stone fly, a crayfish 2 mites, and a couple mosquito larva the water is much slower than last time we samples and theyre is now plenty of debris creating homes for the macro-invertebrates.
Site #4 in the center of the side channel in a new stream formed by the floods. We found 9 cadisflies, 4 rifle beetles, 11 stoneflies, 3 mites, 2 blackflies, and 5 mosquito larva.
The floods reduced the flow that comes into the side channel because  it moved the logs that had been place to funnel the water in.  This resulted in slower moving water that is easier for things to live in. The flood also placed large amount of plant debris into the side channel further slowing the water and making a great environment for the macro-invertebrates."
