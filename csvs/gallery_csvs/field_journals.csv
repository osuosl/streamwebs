"A Day on Whychus"," Walking along the dusty trail beside the creek, I look around where I was and smiled. It always makes me happy whenever I am outside, especially in the wilderness. The beauty and importance of the area made me feel good that I was at least learning about what I could do to help out the Whychus Creek habitat and make it a better place for fish and other wildlife. I took in a deep breath and let it out slowly. The fresh air and peacefulness the area provided was accentuated after a long day of being cooped up in classroom after classroom of boring lectures. I was grateful of being able to do this class and participate in activities like this where it actually feel like I am making a difference. The creek bubbled along to my left as I admired the lush, but depressingly undersized riparian zone surrounding it. Farther off the creek bed, to my right, large Ponderosa pine trees loomed high above me, showing a surprisingly vast difference in the type of vegetation thriving in the area. It amazed me to think that something that looked like it could survive in a fairly dry, almost desertous climate, could be found in such close proximity to other plants, such as alders, willows, and grasses, that depended so heavily on a lush riparian zone. This really showed the diversity of wildlife that we are lucky to experience here in Sister, OR. At that moment, I became much more aware of how important it is for all of us to put forth an effort to maintain the natural wildlife of the area we call home.

	Today 7 kids from the Troy School monitored both the Grande Ronde and Wenaha rivers, right near the confluence of the two rivers. About 4-5 anglers were in the river during our data collection but none of them caught a fish while we were at the river.

	 

	It was a great day on the river. It had rain the past 24 hours but today it was partly cloudy and the sun was shining. The kids were also in the process of making ""Do No Litter"" Signs to remind anglers, rafters, and visitors to pick up after themselves. We even picked up a few pieces of trash.

"Notes on site/plants","

		you will need to make sure that you know weather it is shady or sunny in different areas in order to find they correct type of plants.

		find plants to plant that provide shade for other plants, help avoide invasive plants, stabalize the bank

		need plants with different life spans to help with decomposition. you need plants that will die earlier so that they (trees) can fall into the water and provide decomposition, and slow the current for the salmon.

		check plants weather tollerance. in most areas at some point they will be fully submerged in the river


			also when planting the new plants, you need to check the softness of the soil, and be aware that there is a layer of sand over the soil.



			 



			 



	AREA:


		sunny

		tons of moisture

		at times will be hit by flood water, submerging entire bank

		ideal for plants that need a ton of water

		needs plants to stablize bank (i.e. deep strong roots)


	LOCAL PLANTS:


		sowrd fern

		native oxalis

		western hemlock tree

		big leaf maple

		salmon berry shrub

"Salmon Watch at Cedar Creek- Fall 2010","
	 

	Our Salmon Watch trip brought us out to Cedar Creek, off the Wilson River, near the Tillamook Forest Center. Throughout the day, we cycled through four stations exploring various aspects of stream ecology. The most impressive activity was the viewing of salmon returning to their home stream for spawning. This station was led by a ODFW Fish Biologist, Dave Plawman, who taught us details of the salmon cycle, with a focus on the spawning stage. He also had frozen salmon for us to look closely at. A total of 7 mature salmon were spotted by us, all of which were Fall Chinook to our surprise.  We expected to see Coho Salmon. 

	At the “Riparian Study” station, we took hikes through the forest surrounding the creek. We collected interesting natural objects to discuss.  Near a natural “swale” (season pond), we looked at tree canopy cover with a “spherical densitometer” that rated the percentage of tree cover. This is extremely important for a Salmon stream due to the need for cold, shaded water.  We then performed a partial ‘riparian transect’, in which we analyzed the plant growth, including percentage of shrubs and trees. 

	At the “Water Quality” station we started by measuring the temperature of the stream water and air.  Then dissolved oxygen (DO) was measured.  The DO rating varied from 9 ppm to 10 ppm, which indicates great Salmon water.  The pH testing also fell within the healthy range with an average of 7.18.  We measured the water ‘Turbidity’ (water clarity) with a turbidity tube. The rating of 3 also shows the overall healthiness of Cedar Creek.  We do wish that we could have used the high tech “Vernier” testing equipment more at this station. 

	The “Macroinvertebrate” station used “kick netting” which is a different method from the “Leaf Pack” experiments we are use to. We found a predominance of Stonefly and Mayfly, with a healthy overall EPT percentage 88.99%. This is pretty consistent with what we have found with our Leaf Pack program. 

	An unique part of our Salmon Watch program was that most of station instruction was provided by high school students from Centennial Learning Center. Their teacher, Tyler Duvall, had prepared them well for the task and they did a great job.  

	Our Salmon Watch data can be viewed at the StreamWebs web site at:    http://streamwebs.org/locations/cedar-creek  We really had a wonderful day, filled with amazing applied experience and learning. ","2010-11-14 13:59","3020","57","Cedar Creek"
"Mussel count / Site notes","
	Mussel count for the Bill Curtis site : transect 1 was downstream and transect 10 was upstream. Trans 1: 99 mussels / trans 2: 70 mussels / trans 3: 5 mussels / trans 4: 14 mussels / trans 5: 19 mussels / trans 6: 3 mussels / trans 7: 15 mussels / trans 8: 0 mussels / trans 9: 11 mussels / trans 10: 10 mussels

	 

	Site notes:

	The Bill Curtis site team noticed that the farther upstream we went the more filter feeding plants we saw. As well as more dead, broken, or fragile looking mussel. Small snails were spotted everywhere along the site in and out of the water, along the banks and under leaves. Under the overhanging brush near transect 5 where the water moved slower, we noticed a small grouping of what looked like mayflys, 8 or so. More or bigger rocks with less silt seemed to mean less mussels. Downstream had a much larger variety of size's when looking at the mussels. slow moving riffles is where the mussels liked to be.","2010-11-16 18:54","3040","118","CWA Johnson Creek --- 307th/Orient"

"Invasive Species Disaster","
	     It was our first day on the job, removing ivy, holly, stinky bob's, and more, when we saw it. The biggest ivy vine we'd ever seen was strapped to a tree, clinging for dear life! It was as thick as boa constrictor and as strong as one too. No matter what we did it wouldn't even budge!  Mallory grabbed onto a smaller piece of it and started to pull. It wasn't giving, so she put both feet on the tree and used all of her weight to try and bring it down. For a while she sat there, laughing at it's strength. Then, suddenly, it gives. In shock, Mallory let go of the vine and went tumbling down! She landed on her hand but it was hurt too bad. To this day that ivy vine still stands there, bringing insult to injury. Next weeks plan of attack, handsaws.

	The first time our group, wild-life and plant specialists, was out at the Tenino Court Site we built a bridge over the little stream. We used only the things that were out at the site, including fallen logs, branches, leaves, and even some of the English Ivy, that the invasive species team took out. 

	This last time, November 9, we went to look for and identify different plants and animal tracks. We found Crane's-Bill Moss, which is a pretty common moss that grows throughout Oregon. As well as Sword Ferns, which we learned grow in bunches, Nodding Tristetum, a type of grass, and a Scourning Rush, which belongs to the Horsetail family. There were also two trees we identified; a Big Leaf Maple and a Western Redcedar. The only tracks we found were deer tracks and there were very few of them.  Overall, it was interesting day.","2011-11-09 14:16","3654","230","Tenino Court Site"

"Holly & Ivy, My Worst Enemies!!! - Invasive Species Removal","
	Once upon a time there were two friends, Holly and Ivy. Holly grew from the ground to be as tall as a small tree looming over the plants under her. Meanwhile Ivy climbed up trees to the very tippty-top. They both liked the Tenino Court site so much they told their families. After their families came they started to over take the land! And although they did not mean to they started to over populate the native plants to the area causing them to die off or move away! Together these friends took over the Tenino Court site and demolished the native plants that once lived there!!!

	    This is why on 11/9/11 us students at CWA (Clackamas Web Academy) ripped out as much English Ivy and English Holly we could! We pulled a lot out, now we have a BIG pile of all the Ivy and Holly to decompose! These two friends from England brought with them the ability to demolish our native plants! To save our environment we must team up and fight against these evil forces to save our native plants! We (CWA) will continue to fight England's evil plants!","2011-11-10 09:57","3674","120","Tenino Court Site"
"CWA Invasive Species Removal Team","
	     The CWA Invasive Species Removal Team have worked really hard to clear out as much of the invasive English Holly and English Ivy at the Tenino Court Site as we can. Although we have struggled to rip down the massive English Ivy vines and dig up the enormous English Holly roots you can definitely see a decline in the amount of the invasive species still living. Us students are working quickly and efficiently in the removal process. We (CWA students) have made a huge pile of the English Holly and English Ivy that we have already removed. Leaving the vines and Holly branches to decompose naturally and letting them leave there nutrients in the same location as they were. If we were to remove the plants all together then we would be taking nutrients needed for native plants to survive.","2011-11-10 16:08","3682","129","Tenino Court Site"
"A Day in the Invasive Species Removal Team","
	     If you think picking weed in your back yard is hard, try picking weeds in the Tenino Court site! The ivy can be thick as pythons and as abundant as bugs. The holly can be as tall as trees! The pile really builds up after hours of hard work, and soon it's taller then me!(which I know isn't saying much.) The boys were soon becoming restless needed to do something stupid. So they jumped into the pile with a CRUNCH!  The pile was never the same after that. Instead of being a thing of greatness it became a depressing pile of dead plants. Now we know never to leave a perfectly good pile of dead plants lying around when boys become bored

"Soil Chemistry Team First Week Testing","
	 October 26th, 2011 around 10:30am.

	     Today is our first day being out to the site to test soil chemistry. My group and I obtained our first sample near the northwestern border of our site. This location was near a large vine maple tree and a skinny sword fern. We first tested the amount of phosphorus this soil contained. However, during this test we made a mistake and used the wrong reading chart; therefore yielding inaccurate results. After this test, my team and I acquired a different sample of soil. I'm not sure why our team procured another sample; I concluded that we were all very confused and disorganized with the new equipment. Nevertheless, we tested the new sample for its pH level. This sample was taken from the left shore of the small creek that trickles through our site. Yet again, our team made a crucial mistake in our testing. We misread the instructions and used the incorrect test tube for the pH test, once more resulting in a false outcome. We attempted to test pH again on this soil sample, but our team remained unfocused and only received an erroneous product. Having no success in our soil testing today was very frustrating. However, my team now has more experience with the testing equipment than we did before. I'm very sure our group will have success on our next visit.

	 November 9th around 10:30am

	     Today is our second day being out to the site to test soil chemistry. The last time our team came out to the field our only results were inaccurate. Today, the outcomes changed. We began by taking a new sample from the same location as our first test. That is, the sloping area near the northwestern border of our site. We first re-tested this soil for the phosphorus level. Our results were that the soil from that location was low on phosphorus. The second test we ran was for pH levels. The outcome was that the soil was very acidic; the pH level was 7.5. Our third test, however, may have turned incorrect. We ran the nitrogen test and came out with lower than low nitrogen levels. The final test we ran today was for potassium levels. We concluded with medium to low levels. Unfortunately, we ran out of time after our fourth test. I hope we will research how to raise phosphorus and nitrogen levels, and also how to lower pH levels.","2011-11-17 16:00","3711","283","Tenino Court Site"

"Interesting Finds.","
	November 30th, 2011.

	Today was, to some, the best day we've had in the field ever!! For starters the invasive species team found not one, but two salamanders. The sad part is that one of the salamanders lost its tail trying to help out with the pulling of the ivy. Another thing they found was an abondon bird's nest, which is in almost perfect condition.

	So while the Invasive species was finding all this, I was helping the Special Ops team of the week, the media team. We were presented with the task of building a lean-to, which was kind of fun building once we all knew what we were doing. Though the lean-to is still just a frame, the next special ops team will begin filling in the holes, we believe it to be a work of art and good enough for any survivalist. Overall I believe it to be a great day!","2011-11-30 14:40","3735","230","Tenino Court Site"

The group first searched for a good spot for their lean-to, then gathered logs and sticks to build the structure. after many logs where put up one of the members got on top of the structure and tied English Ivy to the tops of the logs and then to the beam that they where leaning against, to ensure maximum security.

"First day of a proper job","
	This week was the first day I was actually doing anything of value for a good chunk of the time (as I have been moved to the Wildlife team). We spent a good part of the day following some tracks--opossum, raccoon, and what could have been coyote, but could also have been a dog (sadly, I'm inclined to choose the latter).

	After we followed the tracks a ways, we decided to go off and identify some trees, plants, and shrubs with mixed success; the only plants we came across--that didn't fall under the other two categories--were sword ferns, and a tiny  little ground-hugging plant I can't for the LIFE of me identify.

	The only shrubs we found were holly.

	There seem to be a lot of maple and alder trees, from what I can tell, what with them having no leaves.

	Until now, I hadn't seen that far into the site, so it was interesting to explore the more closed woody part, and also where the creek actually looked as though it could support life. It will be really great to get that whole area cleared up and planted with native... plants.

	Hi, my name is Toby Broadie. I'm in this group called ""water quality"" and we take information from the creek in  Tenino Court and put it on this website. We take information such as temperture, ph levels, turbidity, dissolved oxygen and stream flow. So far I have enjoyed this experience and hope my group and whoever else does too.","2012-01-11 20:45","3785","273","Tenino Court Site"
"Spec Ops","
	     Every other week when CWA is down at the site one group is chosen to do the ""special operation"" of the day. When my group was chosen to do the ""special operation"" I was excited. Our assignment was to build some sort of sclupture out of any thing we could find. It sounded easy but we spent a good 30 mins trying to figure out what to do. We ended up building a giant CWA ""Clackamas Web Academy"" sculpture. It was built out of branches and vines. Overall I wasn't too impressed but it was pretty cool.","2012-01-11 20:55","3786","273","Tenino Court Site"
"First day in the field.","
	      Our very first day out in the field (11/9) was a very busy day for my group (wild life and plant specialists). On this day we got the privilege to be the special ops team and our job was to build a bridge using only the ""dead"" objects that we could find. First we briefly planned out what we're going to do and then we got to work. Considering the fact that our group consists of 3 girls, the process was a little difficult and slow at first. Most of the time, it would take all 3 of us to carry a big log, fortunately there were some gentleman that helped us a few times. The stream that the bridge had to go over was considerably small but we had to build it with the fact in mind that soon it's going to start raining more and the stream will get bigger. 
	     At the end of the day, we were successful at building the bridge that consisted of big logs that served as the foundation and small sticks and some rocks that filled in the holes. We also covered the bridge with moss and some dirt so that some of the small sticks would stay in place. After that, we rapped the bridge with English Ivy (thank you invasive species team for donating) and being girls, we managed to decorate the bridge by building somewhat of railings using the ivy. Unfortunately, the next time we were in the field, the railings were no longer in their original place. Over all it was a very active and therefore awesome day!","2012-01-12 12:28","3788","232","Tenino Court Site"
"It actually looked wild today.","
	This week's trip was rather pointless. We trudged about in the dull, dirty remains of inclement weather and made tiny snowpeople with them.

	The creek was insane in comparison to itself when we first went out to the site.

	I did enjoy our mini photoshoot, however. It was fun hearing and carrying out different ideas.","2012-01-18 13:25","3807","248","Tenino Court Site"
"CWA students","
	1/18/12

	     This Wednesday the CWA River Science and Environmental Science students worked really hard to complete there tasks in the freezing temperatures. Everyone dressed warm and was managed to keep themselves at least slightly warm. The Invasive species removal team was able to dominate a new area of English Ivy. Removing all if the ivy off another hillside. Everything is starting to look allot cleaner since the Ivy has been pulled. Even though we had to get through the bad weather, risen stream, snow patched, and sprinkles of rain, the CWA students seemed to enjoy themselves when it came time to build miniature snowmen. Every team was able to create their own 'new' member of the group. Once again everyone seemed to have a great time.

"2-18","
	     This was the last field day of this semester but it was by far the best day. It was much more ""wild"" than it usually is. This was the cause of the rainy and freezing weather which even brought some snow! A lot of people were absent that day, including one of our team mates. This was unfortunate because it was the last and the only day that we could take our group picture. However the ""photoshoot"" was very fun and we were successful at photoshopping her into the picture. 

	     Our field was a lot different from what it is usually like. The biggest difference (at least to me) was the noise of the stream which wasn't present before, it was due to the high level of water in it. There was even an extra stream created from all the water. 

	     There was another thing different this day, the Special Ops assignment had to be done by everybody at the end of class. Our job was to make a new member of our team out of snow. It had to include details that would indicate which group it is in. Our snowman was considerably small to the usual size but we also made a turtle and a deer that surrounded it. We clothed our little friend with moss and leaves. After that we named him some male name, (which I unfortunatelly don't remember) because we needed a male member in our team to help us with some things we weren't able to do ourselves. 

	     At the end of the day, our snowman was voted the best and with numb hands and feet we headed to the max.","2012-01-23 21:50","3815","232","Tenino Court Site"

	    Last Wednesday my class went to the Tenino Court site to remove English Ivy and prepare for planting new trees.

	We began by heading through the snow toward the area marked for clearing. once we were to the hill we started to pull the ivy out. we worked for about an hour  and when we were finished the hill was cleared. I think that what we are doing is very good for the environment and I wish that more people were willing to try to make a difference.","2012-01-24 16:17","3818","297","Tenino Court Site"

	 A few wednesdays ago we were removing English Ivy at the Tenino court site when we found that underneath the ivy littering the ground was a stash of cinderbricks. We decided that to help make the Tenino Court site a better place we needed to also clean up this stash of cinderbricks so a quarter of our group began removing the cinder bricks while the other half kept removing the ivy.

"Today was great.","
	I'd say this was a good kick-off for being assigned to different teams. I'm still somewhat of a floater, but today I pretty much lived up to my position as an honorary Wildlife and Plant Specialist member and traipsed off to identify some nature.

	My group was in charge of plants; we successfully identified and noted down alder, maple, hemlock, and red cedar trees, encountered some Robert Geranium (a.k.a. ""stinky Bob""), ivy, and holly, and of course navigated through copious amounts of sword ferns. There were also some plants in/by the water that I have yet to identify.

	After that, I was taken off to the side to listen for some birds. I was surprised to hear a northern flicker among the chickadees, song sparrows, robins, and lone scrub jay; hopefully it will find both a place and the motivation to nest here when the time comes.

	Speaking of birds, there were a lot more and they were much more active than usual. I actually came within close proximity of a song sparrow a few times, and before we dispersed into our groups, I had seen a robin poking about on the ground. Later I noticed a scrub jay and what could have possibly been the flicker in the trees, but they were both too far off to get a proper look.

	Nature is very clearly waking up.

	 

	At any rate, despite not having done any drawing this trip, I must say that I enjoyed myself more than I had any previous time, and it was quite fun noting things and putting my birding skills to actual use. I felt like a scientist. Science is the best.","2012-02-15 14:51","3903","248","Tenino Court Site"

"The forgotten journal entry...","I was so sure that I had already submitted this entry but turns out I didn’t, and it will be a bit of a challenge trying to remember what happened on the first field day of this semester…
This was the first day of me being the group leader of Wild Life and Plant Specialists team. We split into two groups. One group explored the flora part of the area and my group explored the fauna. We found some traces of a running deer, as well as some evidence of a raccoon. It seemed like a usual field day except for one thing: birds. They have finally awoken from this long, rainy winter on this sunny day. This was the time that I regretted not reading those dusty, old books about birds that I have. Fortunately there was Bryn who is an experienced bird identifier. Some of the birds that she was able to identify included song sparrows, robins, lone scrub jays, northern flickers, and chickadees. Overall it was a great, sunny day.","2012-03-30 11:38","3974","232","Tenino Court Site"

Which is kind of sad in a way considering how much work we put into it..I hope I'm not the only one that has grown attached. Anyway today was a pretty awesome day. We got down to work right away. My team pulled out so much ivy and holly. One of the funny parts of the day was when Kevin lost his shoe while jumping on the pile. Another one was when I was pulling out Holly and it suddenly gave away and I went falling backwards, screaming as I went. I caused quite a commotion.
 The funnest part for everybody was when we played Camouflage, a game where stealth is absolutely necessary.
All in all it was a good way to say good bye and farewell to Tenino Court :)

"Frozen pinky toes.","     On this freezing and wet March day, my group and I decided to stay together and simply explore. We went to the areas of the field to which we've never been to. We discovered some mysterious things such a a tire, a bicycle part, and a closed jar that contained dissolved...something? To this day, we do not know who put it there or what the bizarre thing inside of it is. As we zig-zagged (crossed over and over again) the river, we noticed some raccoon and deer tracks. 
     At one point, we found a big whole in a tree and my two teammates crossed over the river to see it. As I started crossing the river by walking on a log that was in the river, I lost my balance but reclaimed it once my right side fell into the water. Fortunately, I only got my right leg wet up to my knee. After coming home that day, I put my feet into hot water because I could no longer feel them. When I was finally worm I still could not feel the pinky toes on both of my feet. Thus the title of my journal. 
     Altogether it was an integrative experience of curiosity, discovery, and cold feet.","2012-04-04 15:37","3981","232","Tenino Court Site"

When there are tracks we can use them to see what kind of animal species live in the area!

"Reenactment of the Hunger Games.","     Today was our last day in the field and we once again split into groups, except this time Halle and Sarynn's little brother Zach and their mother Lisa helped joined our group. I was with Mallory walking along the river when she found a white flower (picture will go up soon) that she identified as a trillium! It was very interesting to see such beauty in the middle of dirt and spiky bushes. We also recognize a Robin and a Western Scrub-jay. I really enjoyed seeing the nature finally awakening and noticing small buds and leaves growing on trees.
     Something interesting and somewhat disturbing happened today when I found a very small (half an inch) round, brown-ish item. I touched it and it stuck to my fingers. When I smelled it, I realized what it was...So today I learned not to ever touch brown round things ever again!
     Another part of this day included a game. After asking twice about what we're supposed to do, I ""kind of"" got it. However I really enjoyed running as fast as I could and hiding quietly.

We, the Invasive Species Removal team, worked very hard to remove as much ivy as we could before our work was done this semester. We also enjoyed treats provided by some of my classmates. In the end, we all participated in a game called Camouflage. The game involved everybody trying to reach the person in the middle of the area; this was difficult due to the fact that we were not to be seen. I was able to do this by hiding behind our Principal, who was standing behind the person I needed to reach. The very moment he closed his eyes to count, I jumped up and tagged him. Fun Indeed.

"The Last Field Day","The 4th of April, 2012
  Here on the Invasive Species Removal Team I have learned two very important things: first, I have learned how invasive plants can slowly kill native plants and drain the soil of its nutrients. Second, I have come to understand that invasive plants don't stand a chance at survival if they happen to encounter Kevin Moore while he's in possession of a pickaxe. I'd like to give a formal thanks to the Environmental Literacy/River Science Class for teaching me these two very significant lessons on life. I would also like to address Deena Sevy, my English Holly removal partner. Thank you Deena for helping me to remove that dastardly evil Holly. I really enjoyed working with you and watching as you amazingly ate those two doughnuts and six cookies today. Thanks for the best, last field day ever, everyone!","2012-04-25 08:32","4015","283","Tenino Court Site"
"March 21, 2012 Field Day"," The 21st of March, 2012
  Garden gloves on. Shovels in hand. Holly in sight. And so it began. Deena and I drove our shovels into the rain-loosened dirt around the base of the Holly tree. We pulled and dug and kicked with Holly leaves scratching our faces and dirt flying into our hair. As the battle raged on, Deena and I swung our shovels at the abnormally large Holly bush. Still, the roots wouldn't budge and the plant stood firm. We were bound and determined to pull this native plant murder out of the ground and deliver it the death that it deserved, however. So we continued to fight the massive shrub. Our mighty struggle must have been seen and heard from every corner of the site because soon, Kevin came walking over to us, his dirt-caked pickaxe resting on his shoulder. He then asked us to step aside for a moment. We watched incrediously as Kevin swung his pickaxe over his head and down onto the roots of the invasive plant twice, then pulled the entire tree out of the ground with a single yank. He grabbed the recently deceased plant and held it over his head then ran back over to the rest of the team, all the while releasing some sort of victorious battle cry. All of that drama from Deena and I only to have our moment be stolen? Life's so unfair.","2012-04-25 09:01","4016","283","Tenino Court Site"

"Last Field Day","The last field day was a blast! We got to eat cookies and donuts, I mean what is better that. For the last field day we where supposed to look up an animal that uses camouflage, but I forgot to read that email. But reading that email would have came in handy, during the game we played. We played a game called Camouflage. I'm pretty sure I was the easiest person to see, I had my zebra print rain boots on and a bright blue jacket. But I thought the game was really fun. So overall the last field day was a success! ","2012-04-27 11:24","4021","231","Tenino Court Site"
"What I've Learned","   During the time at the Tenino Court Site I have learned a lot. On the first field day our team had the special oops assignment. We were assigned to build a bridge. So we gathered up some long and short branches, but only the ones that where already on the ground. Once we where done it actually looked like a bridge, not a very stable bridge but a good bridge. I also learned how to work in a team and display teamwork. Working in a team can be a challenge but it can also be a lot of fun. The Tenino Court Site has brought some great memories, and it will be missed!","2012-04-27 11:40","4022","231","Tenino Court Site"

"first day in the field","This week was my first week back in the field  since last school year. it was so good to see the familiar sites and people. This year I'm in invasive species removal group. This week was seven of us including Noah. Noah works for Jonson Creek Water Shed, he mainly works with school groups. I was with him last year and we had lots of fun the first week with Noah was already awesome and I look foreword to many more days with him. 
At the beginning of class we do some fun game this weeks was you had to say your name and do your favorite dance move. We then split in to are groups we started pulling ivy of trees. It was to hard to pull ivy out of the ground because it was to dry. It was a lot of work but it was also fun. It was amazing to see a tree but really all you could see was ivy it was all over, all we can see was green leaves and vines. Are job was was to remove the ivy it was so cool to see all the ivy on the ground but none on the trees. ","2012-10-17 13:16","4467","274","Tenino Court Site"

"Field Journal","  On our first day on the field we got to know each other better, and plan out what groups we were to go in. The group I went in had to search the area for water because there was no rain for several weeks we couldn't find any. Instead of joining another group right away our leader walked us through our equipment so we could know how to use it better for the next field day. After we were done we went to help the invasive species group. We helped them remove the plants were harming the trees and growing on them. We used two different tools to cut them off. It was fun and challenging to get the vine to come off the trees. Some of the vines were thick enough to go around your whole hand. Without the help of the tools it would of been imposable to get them off. It was very fun first trip and I hope the next one will be even better.","2012-10-22 18:43","4477","375","Tenino Court Site"

I am really glad to be a part of a team where everyone works together , and everyone has a specific job to make our field day a success. I am also glad to be the communications person for our group , I also feel that everyone else in my team has pretty much nominated me the team leader. Today our group only had three people but we still made sure that every job got done . Today we actually finished really early so we created three more photo points. Once all 11 photo points were graphed , measured and coordinated we had successfully completed our team task . Once finishing our team task we went over to help the invasive species team to pull out some ivy . Today went really well and I am grateful and thankful to be on a team where everyone works together as a team, to get the job done successfully . I was always told there is no I in team and it's true we all worked together and make a really great team. ","2012-10-24 14:09","4480","240","Tenino Court Site"

"Week one Photo point :)","     The first day in the field was a ton of fun. I like my group we are all pretty awesome. I am in the Photo Point Monitoring group. I take the photos, and I am the one that measures the distance of the camera spot from the stream and from the board.
     On our first day we took seven photo points. We took two photos from the middle of the stream, facing the opposite ways. Then we took two other photos, they were photo point spots from last year. One of the photos from last year were taken up the stream a ways from all of our other ones. The other photo from last year was of a leaf decomposition that we made last year. This year we just added more leaves to it so that we can see these leaves change this year.
     After taking do the other photo points we when to the main center area that we meat at the beginning at. We realized that we got done early, like we did all of last year. So we just all went around and took photos of other groups and what they were doing.
     When it was about time to leave we all went to the center area again and all went around talking about what we liked the most about the day and our groups. Ten when we were done with that we all went around looking for some kids phone because he lost it somewhere. Finally we all had to leave because the class was over, but we did not find the kids phone. The next week that we go out there I bet someone will find it.
     The thing that I remember the most is that the group was late again like almost all of last year. Me and My brother Sam drive to the location that they meat us at. So we are always there before the rest of the group. It is a lot of fun waiting there for them though. Because Noah is there too with us waiting. Me and my brother always help get everything out of Noah's car and then me, him, and Noah always just stand around and talk to each other.","2012-10-25 22:57","4546","280","Tenino Court Site"
"Forestry/tree boring","Field Journal 10/24/2012
     Today my team and I used a tree borer to age some of the trees. A tree borer is a drill with a T handle that you turn to make the drill sink into the tree.  It has a hole in the center of the drill where a plug of the tree goes.  When you drill you have to be completely level and you have to drill to the center of the tree.  This way you get a good plug that has all the rings of the tree.  Each ring of a tree represents a year of growth.  Besides the age of the tree the plug can tell you which years the tree was able to grow faster.  The thicker rings happened in better growing years, plenty of rain, good weather, etc.  By counting the rings back from the present we can tell which years droughts might have happened and things like that.
   We tested three trees.  The first tree was a cedar and it was 16 years old.  It showed pretty steady growth, all the rings were the same thickness, until the past three years.  The second tree we tested was thirty or thirty-one years old.  It was also a cedar.  All of it's rings were thinner than the first trees and the rings varied in thickness.  It seemed that every third ring was skinnier than the others so it almost made a pattern. The last tree we did was another cedar tree growing right next to the creek.  It was the biggest one we tested with forty nice big rings.
     We tried to test hard wood trees like maples, but the wood was so hard we couldn't get a core sample. The drill just wouldn't sink in.  So all of our samples had to be on the cedars which have soft wood.  We didn't bother testing any alders because they were so skinny.   ","2012-10-26 22:43","4547","379","Tenino Court Site"
"second day in the field","Today was are second day in the field. Me and my sister drive to class incited of riding the max to save time this was the first time that we were ever right on time. We all went down and got in are ""circle"" and played a game. It was a very interesting game I had never played it before. But the only problem was that we had to know peoples name and I did not know every ones name because I'm really bad at remembering names.
We then split of into our group to go do our different jobs. My groups job is to know the different invasive species and remove them. It can be very hard to remove invasive species such as ivy you need grab at the roots and pull and then most of the time the roots would come up to. It is different however to pull ivy of of trees, you need to cut of all the ivy at the base and around the tree but leave the stuff growing way up in the tree because it will die.
Some times we can get bored or tired of pulling ivy but we need to keep on track. We pulled all most a hole hillside of ivy in an hour and a half. Our group starts of with about 8 people in it which is the invasive species team but near the end of the class like if photo point monitoring finishes yearly they would come help us pull ivy which is very helpful.

"week two in the feild!! :)","    This week when we were out in the field for the field day we had one less person. We had one less person because Jared or some people call him bubbles dropped out of the class. Phelicia was the one that took the task of taking over Jared's spot and the stuff that he did. Jared would always be in charge of holding the meter board.
    Even though Jared is gone we still got a lot done and got done early. Since we got done so early we went and made more photo points. We made three more photo points, that put us up at having eleven photo points all together.
    When we got all the way done with the points we started helping in invasive species. We helped pull a lot of ivy. It was a lot of fun. We got to hangout while we worked. We got to work with people that we normally don’t work with, so that made it a lot more fun. Almost all of the groups were done with there stuff and were working with the invasive species group too.
    When it was time to meet back up in the center area Terri asked me to yell marshmallow, I did. It was really fun and funny because there were still some people gone but most of them were there already and when I yelled that they all looked at me like I was some kind of freak. In all the day was really good. ","2012-10-31 15:25","4551","280","Tenino Court Site"

"Field Journal","On our last Field day their was actually a creek. We got to test the creeks water for the first time. The water we were going to test was up the creek. The ground was very wet and slippery. realized how much I need to buy some boot. When we got to a good spot upstream to test we stopped and put down our stuff. We first tested the water clarity. It was hard to find a deep enough spot to fill the bottle all the way. When we finished filling the bottle we found that the water quality was great. We then finish with the other tests like ph and turbidity. 
    After we we finished with the test and had them written down we headed up stream to look for pipes that lead into the creek. When we walked up stream for awhile we had to stop because it lead into someone property. So on our way back we picked up garbage and found a tier in the creek. We stopped to pull it out. The tier was deep in the ground in the creek and was very hard to pull it out. When we got it out we pull out as much mud as we could. After we got most of it out we pushed it up the hill.  We dropped it off and went to help the invasive species for the rest of the day. We were pulling out vines that were all over a hill. It was a very successful day and should help lots of plants that were struggling to grow on the hill.","2012-11-14 13:55","4607","375","Tenino Court Site"
"forestry progres report","     We had perfect weather; blue skies, no rain, and warm a temperature for this time of year.  The leaves have started to turn colors and fall.  The creek is low and the ground is not too muddy.  I think all of the teams made great progress.  Especially the invasive species team.  They cleared a whole area of ivy, roots and all.
     My team mate and I gathered measurements on several trees.  We were able to estimate the height of most of the trees we have diameter measurements for.  We named each tree T1 thru T8.  I used an equation to figure out how tall each tree was.  The equation uses the distance from the trunk of the tree measured in feet, where I can see the top of the tree through the sights of the triangle shaped measuring device.  It has a bubble in it so I can hold it perfectly level to get an accurate reading.  Then I added to my line of sight height, which is five feet, to get the total height of the tree.  I think the tool uses the Pythagorean theorem. The angles are set so the calculation is based on the length of the one leg of the triangle, which is the distance from the trunk of the tree.  The tree makes the 90 degree angle to the ground that you need for a triangle with a hypotenuse.  It is so clever.  It sure beats climbing the tree with a tape measure.  So here are the heights of the trees we measured.
     T1:  49.6 feet tall
     T2:  39 feet tall
     T3:  This tree is so tall I ran out of measuring tape long before I could see the top of the tree.  I estimate it would have taken four or five tape measure lengths to reach the spot where I could see the top of the tree.  When I go back I will try to get this information.  We ran out of time so I could not finish.

"third day in the field","This week was our last week in the field for this semester. I feel like a lot of people gave it their all, did exactly what they were supposed to do, and did it well. It can be hard sometimes to do your best when you know there is not much time left. I think that every one did an amazing job.
This week the weather was not that good, but I think that we made the best of it and did a good job. This week we were pulling out ivy along the creek. We pulled out from the homemade bridge down to the end of the property line. The invasive species group has helped the environment so much and we would have not been able to do it without our teachers, so thank you.
It has always been great getting to go outdoors and help the environment and this is a great way to do that. Even if the weather is bad we can still enjoy nature and help nature. It is also really cool to see the plants we planted last year and how they have grown and helped the creek. ","2012-11-28 14:58","4649","274","Tenino Court Site"
"Field days have ended","Our last day in the field was both exciting and informational. We saw a lot of wildlife species bugs and insects that we hadn't seen before. I think since the ground was moist and cool it was a more persuasive climate and habitat for the bugs to enjoy. While we were entering the field today their was an air of enjoyment mixed with sadness and anticipation. While these emotions were somewhat relevant the ability to complete the task given was not altered. I in my personal opinion believe today was the most fun we've had in class to date. And am excited for our last class and the chance to meet Robin Cody in person.

"Obligatory personal entry","My experience with this class is vastly better than it was last year, because this group of students is easier to be around for the most part, my assigned team makes sense and has an actual purpose, and I get to run around collecting ~tree data~, which is kind of what I want to do with my life as it is.
Even though it's wickedly cold in the morning and I have to get up at a ridiculously early hour and be where I need to a whole hour earlier than I actually need to (thanks, TriMet schedule), the weather hasn't been nearly as bad as it could be and even this last time, when it was actually raining, it hasn't rendered us unable to do anything. Also, I appreciate that we'll be taking January and February off, since it seems as though we weren't ever able to do our jobs on field days during those months.
The rain aside, I think this week's outing was the best, since both my teammate and I had a system going and really knew what we were doing and how to do it; everything ran very efficiently. Also, I got to take samples of what are probably the oldest trees on the site, which was immensely cool. Even if they aren't really all THAT old.","2012-11-30 19:36","4686","248","Tenino Court Site"
"Field Journal","On this field day the group I was in got a lot done. The last time we were testing the water quality it took us 1 hour to get one spot tested but this time we got 4. We first started on the place we did two weeks ago then went upstream approximately 30 feet. We saw some difference in the test and decided to go upstream more. I had to walk on the side of the hill because the ground was so muddy. After finishing the test there we notice that we still had lots of time left and went down to the entrance where the bridge is. We remembered that we never tested the water there and began the tests. When we were finished we grabbed something to drink and joined the invasive species group in pulling out vines. During our time there we pulled out lots on vines and got a stump out of the ground. It was a very successful day and we seem to get more done each time.

"The last week in the field before Christmas break!! :)","     The last field day that we had, which is also the last field day until March and the last one in our groups, was an awesome one. I had a ton of fun taking photos, holding the board, and using the GPS.
    Me and my brother got there at ten to start the day off because we did not want to be late. We were there for about ten minutes before anyone else got there so after five minutes my brother was wondering if we were still going to have class that day. Then when Noah and Ryan showed up we knew for sure that we were going to have class. The whole time we sat in the car me and him were practicing our bird calls.
    A little bit latter the class showed up and we all started heading down the hill. when we all finally made it down the hill we circled up like we normally do and we started to do our bird calls. I was going to do one but by the time I got enough confidence someone else had already done the one I was planning on doing. It was fine though anyways because I was really nervous about doing my bird call and I did not have to because someone had already done it.
    After we were done with that we went into each of our groups and did what we normally do. Again this week we finished early. We went back to the center, there was a lot of people just standing around talking and waiting for their hot chocolate. I did not really care to have hot chocolate so I went over to Noah and asked him if they needed any help and asked what I could do to help.
    So he had me start using a shovel to dig deep at the roots and get them loose so that it would be easier to put out of the ground. It was a lot of fun, I got to work near Mrs. Gibson, Noah, and my brother Sam.
    Then we all gathered at the center like always and said things that we liked about the day then went up the hill and left. In all it was a really good day and I had a lot of fun with it.","2012-12-04 22:51","4689","280","Tenino Court Site"
"Field Journal","    On our latest trip to the Tenino Court site we started out with our normal routine. We started in our circle and gave our bird calls there were a very wide variety of them. After we finished giving our bird calls we slit up in our groups and tested in our normal place where we have tested all the previous trips. It was very cold and took longer for us to complete our tasks because our fingers wouldn't move. When we finished with the testing there we went back downstream so we could test the water under the bridge. We saw a slight change in the results when we compared them and it was nearing time to leave.
    In the last hour or so of the trip we went to four corners of the Tenino Court site and logged in the cordenace for a map that we are going to make. I had to take the longer harder trail to the spots because I was wearing tennis shoes not boots and the area we were in was very muddy. When we finished writing down the cordenace we went and got something to drink. It was the end of another successful trip and was a great way to end the first part of our environmental literacy class.","2012-12-10 09:36","4690","375","Tenino Court Site"
"Semester One","Our last day in the field was a bittersweet time to remember and look forward to future visits. My last day in the field was spent trying to examine more available sources of information vital to our project and pulling ivy. While pulling ivy we found lots of interesting bugs insects and small amphibious animals. After that I went to the refreshment station and had some coffe which was actually quite quenching. And to add upon that i was also able to munch on some sugar cubes. While drinking I was able to listen to  others tell stories of outdoor adventures and tell a bit about my own experiences and how they've changed and molded who I am today. After all the fun times it seemed quite sad to have to drop such a wonderful class and wait till march to begin again so As we were in the final circle of this semester We were able to tell others what we enjoyed and what we looked forward to doing in the future. And that sums up my day in the field.","2012-12-14 11:33","4694","368","Tenino Court Site"
"My last experience at Tenino Court","  My last experience working out in the field at Tenino Court was a good one. We left the school and got on the max green line. There weren't as many people on it as I would expect.We then got off at the Flavel stop and walked up the giant hill to get up to the Tenino Court. Once we were finally there we broke up into our groups that we were assigned to and had been in the whole time.
     From what I can remember, it was a pretty nice day outside.It was kinda of chilly but it was sunny. Once I began moving around and getting my blood pumping it was not really that cold anymore. It smelled of decaying leaves, like it always does at the end of the fall season. Depending on where I was at the moment, the ground was dry in some places but almost a complete swamp in others.
     The water chemistry/ water quality group, which is the one that I was assigned to, got good data on the last day. We tested the waters pH level, turbidity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen level. To get a decent sample, sometimes you had to go out in the more swampier parts of Tenino Court, which wasn't a problem for me since I was wearing rain boots, but for some of the other people in my group their shoes were screwed after being out in the muddy parts we sometimes had to go to.
     Overall, it was a good experience. I had a good time at Tenino Court throughout the whole semester but the last day or the trip before that were one of the best/ funnest days we went out there. I look forward to doing it all again next semester.","2013-01-15 12:32","4710","371","Tenino Court Site"

"WELL","The first day back out in the field was actually pretty awesome. Aside from the lovely surprise of warm, sunny weather, I took upon myself a challenge. In our gathering of core samples, we came across a cedar that sort of... split into three different trees. We had no idea how to record data for a case like this, but we figured taking a sample from one of the splits would give us a decent idea of the tree's age, since they were all about the same circumference (eyeballed). The trunk, before the splits, was simply too thick to draw a sample from; plus it didn't make as much sense anyway.
Getting the sample, however, was a challenge. We're convinced that this tree is sentient and out to thwart our every effort.
I climbed up it to get to a position from which I could start boring, but it took about 45 minutes for me to finally get the bit far enough in to stay without my holding it up; after that ordeal, the sampler kept coming out as I was trying to turn the bit, resulting in tiny bits of the core rolling out one at a time that I had to count before they fell. THEN, some of the sample got stuck in the end of the borer bit and we had to spend time getting it out... after getting the borer out of the tree, with great effort (it was almost stuck).
We took another sample but THAT borer almost got stuck too; luckily, this sample was worth all the trouble. Too late to save my cramped legs, though, eh. But what counts is that we GOT THE SAMPLE so that tree can SUCK IT.","2013-03-13 15:00","4767","248","Tenino Court Site"

The property is looking plentiful with wild life! 
Our soil chem group will be working on an awesome project this semester. We will be planting four sword ferns in four different spots on the Tenino Court Site. Our group took the time today to determine the four different spots we will be planting the sword ferns. We have decided to take in account the different factors in the soil also, around the soil. We have concluded to plant in some different spots such as near the creek, on a slope, an open area with no tree cover and lastly, by the composition pile. We have not yet planted the ferns but, we plan on it next time! While we wait until the next outing, the ferns are sitting pretty in my little handy dandy green house.","2013-03-13 19:13","4770","369","Tenino Court Site"

Halle help us pull a lot of ivy and she was next to me so we got to talk while we were pulling the ivy. We were all really close to each other pulling the ivy, instead of spread apart like we normally are.

"core sample of wild cherry tree","This last Wednesday was awesome.  We got a huge tree measured.  It is the first one that big that we have been able to get a sample of.  It was a wild cherry tree and according to the core sample it was 84 years old.  We couldn't find a tapemeasure in the equipment so I will have to get the height next time.  I need to remember to bring a tape measure from home for next field work day so I can do that.  That tree took a long time to get the core sample because the tool has become dull.  I don't know if you can sharpen them or if you just have to replace them,  but we found another core tool that works much better.  It also leaves a much cleaner hole in the tree.  The dull one leaves a more jagged hole.  I don't think it is as good for the tree as the sharp one.  We should fix or retire the dull one.","2013-05-13 00:04","4864","379","Tenino Court Site"

"Another Obligatory Field Journal.","Don't get me wrong; I love being on the forestry team, because my job is easy, core samples are interesting, and I only have one other teammate (who is cool) to deal with.
However, this last week was probably the most satisfying time out in the field, because it felt like we were doing work that ACTUALLY mattered, instead of running around doing weird and mostly useless/unhelpful things.
 
So yeah, we basically just pulled ivy the whole time we were there; I don't really need to explain what we did.
I ripped some up on my own, and when I ran out of big patches to do, I trailed behind some of the bigger groups and pulled up the little ivy plants that they missed.
I'm looking forward to the next time we're out there, doing the same thing. Restoration work is the best.","2013-05-13 17:21","4875","248","Tenino Court Site"

I now plan to construct a graph out of the data I collected. This graph will help people see the information in a more visual way. Once I complete the graph people will easily see what habitat ferns grow best in.  In conclusion, I enjoyed myself while learning about soil chemicals and how ferns grow.","2013-05-14 18:23","4879","408","Tenino Court Site"

It was all green there was almost no brown spots of dirt there were a cupple trails, but that was all. Before there were almost no animals there was an occasional spider or squirrel.

"4/30/13: Kory","    After arriving at site me and my group went over to our testing sites. Being a slow day, we didn't get as much acomplished as we would have liked to. With that said we did test two sites before leaving. The first one was up on what could be the highest embankment. There, where we had previously planted a sword fern, we tested the soil chemistry. The results were: pH 7.5, Phosphorous Low, Potassium Low - Medium, and then someone dumped out the nitrogen solution so that was a bust. The second site in the middle of an open embankment on the right side of the creek, where we had placed another fern, had the following results: pH 7, Phosphorous Low, Potassium Low - Medium, and Nitrogen Low - Medium. What this means, I forgot, but it is valuable information for the environment. And that brings my day to an end.

"May 31, 2017 Summary","This year our focus was to start rehabilitate the creek between LCC and SHS.  Last year the objective was to remove invasives (bullfrogs and scotch broom); however, there is always more scotch broom to remove.  This year we wanted to plant natives like willows at the creek side to help with canopy cover.  Because this was an extremely wet year, the willows had ample opportunity to settle in naturally.  There was much more vegetation this spring.  In addition, with grant money we were able to purchase 4 signs to post on site as a SHS Biology class project and habitat restoration site. Those will get put up after we acquire city approval.
Due to the homeless camps in the vicinity we did not get out as much as we had hoped this year.  Our trail cam was destroyed in Dec or January.  Due to a local PTA grant, we were able to purchase another trail cam, but we have to decide the best place to post it to eliminate the vandalism.  We are hoping to get that up sometime over the summer.  We did manage to get a few great day and night time shots of bears and coyotes.
All in all, it was a very successful year. ","2017-05-31 09:47","41011","996","Viking Creek SHS"
