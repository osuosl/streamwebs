Using StreamWebs
================

*(Note: This user guide will updated accordingly as the StreamWebs website is 
built.)*

StreamWebs allows you to log and browse data for various watershed sites. 
You don't need an account to view data, but in order to add a new site or 
record your own data on StreamWebs, you do need to register. 
Here's how to create an account and get started with StreamWebs. 

Creating an Account
-------------------

Click the "Create Account" tab located near the head of the StreamWebs home 
page. You will be taken to a form which will ask you to provide the following:

* Your date of birth
* Your desired username
* Your desired password 
* Your email address
* Your first and last name
* The name of your school

You can indicate your school by typing all or part or its name into the 
appropriate field. A drop down menu will appear as you type and provide you 
with a list of schools that match what you have typed. You can then select 
your school from there. If you don't see your school listed in the drop down 
menu, first make sure that you are typing the official name of 
your school into the field rather than an abbreviation or nickname-- for 
example, you should type "Oregon State University" instead of "OSU". If your 
school still fails to appear, you can select the "Other" option at the bottom
of the list and enter the name manually. 

When you're done with the form, hit the "Create New Account" button at the
bottom of the page to complete your registration.

Logging In
----------

After your StreamWebs account is set up, you can log in by clicking the 
"Log In" link at the top of the homepage and providing your password and 
username (or, alternatively, your email address). If you've forgotten your 
password, you can get a new one by clicking the "Request New Password" link. 
An email will be sent to you with instructions on how to reset your password.

Sites
-----

Now that you're logged in, you can not only view data for sites, but 
contribute to them as well. 

1. Viewing a Site
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To browse sites, navigate to the "Sites" tab at the top of the homepage. You
can find a specific site by:

1. Typing the site name into the search bar
2. Clicking a location marker on the map 
3. Selecting the site from the pull down menu

Upon selection, you'll be taken to that site's page, where you can view its 
details (name, type, description, images, etc.). Under "Data" is a series of 
checkboxes generated from the site's available data sheets (for more on data
sheets, see the "Resources" section of this document). When you select 
one of these fields, you can:

* View the site's compiled data in a table, or
* View the site's compiled data as a graph, or
* Export the data as CSV file. 

The Compare Feature
"""""""""""""""""""
The "Compare" button on each site's page allows you to compare specific 
categories of data across multiple sites, or with outside resources online. 

1. In the "Compare" section of your current site's page, indicate which type 
   of data you'd like to examine. Then click "Compare." 
2. This takes you to a new page with a list of sites that have the category of
   data you want. Select the sites you'd like to compare your data with. 
3. Hit "Compare" again to generate graphs from each site on the same screen.
